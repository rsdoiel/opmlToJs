## opmlToJs package

### How to install

`npm install opmltojs

### The story

It's an attempt to once and for all solve the problem of making it really easy to read OPML files in JavaScript apps. 

I've been using OpmlParser to do this, but it's awkward, and the xml2Js package is more what I need, so I am going to transition to using this package for my serverside OPML parsing needs. 

Note this package does not expand OPML includes.
