### How to install

`npm install opmltojs

### The story

opmlToJs is an attempt to once and for all solve the problem of making it really easy to read OPML files in JavaScript apps. 

It builds on the <a href="https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js">xml2Js</a> package.

Note this package does not expand OPML includes. 

See the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlToJs/blob/master/test.js">test.js</a> app for an example of how to call it.
