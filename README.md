## opmlToJs package

### How to install

`npm install opmltojs

### The story

It's an attempt to once and for all solve the problem of making it really easy to read OPML files in JavaScript apps. 

I've been using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/opmlparser">OpmlParser</a> to do this, but the xml2Js package is more what I need, so I am going to transition to using this package for my serverside OPML parsing needs. 

Note this package does not expand OPML includes.
